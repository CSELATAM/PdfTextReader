Architecture
=============

1. PDF Parser
2. Semantic Tagging
3. Linker

Current Status
===============

Parser PDF is quite robust and it gathers text from the document.
The next step is to understand the text to extract the metadata,
and feed the Linker.

Work in progress:
- Identify the article (title, body, signature)
- Working on the Linker
